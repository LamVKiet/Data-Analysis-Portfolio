# ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Portfolio
## About

Hi, Iâ€™m Kiá»‡t - a final-year student pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Data Science. Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated strong analytical thinking skills and developed proficiency in SQL, Python, and Power BI. I have hands-on experience with DAX and Power Query for data manipulation and visualization, as well as expertise in data modeling, and diagnostics.

My background includes applying predictive analytics using machine learning techniques such as regression, clustering, and classification. I have gained extensive experience in various types of analytics: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive, employing both quantitative and qualitative methods.

I am particularly passionate about storytelling with data-transforming complex datasets into actionable business insights that drive data-driven decision-making. I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and enhance my skills. Whether working independently or collaboratively, I am motivated by excitement of uncovering valuable insights and using data to solve complex business challenges.

My CV in [pdf].

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Python

#### **ðŸ“Œ Customer Segmentation with RFM: Two Approaches Using Quintiles and K-Means Clustering**

**`Code:`** [Customer Segmentation with RFM: Two Approaches Using Quintiles and K-Means Clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/LamVKiet/RFM-ANALYSIS-QUINTILES-KMEANS-PYTHON/blob/main/RFM-Analysis-Quintiles-KMeans-Python.ipynb)

**`Goal:`** 
- Implement an RFM analysis model for behavior-based customer segmentation using a pizza store dataset, applying two methods:

  - RFM with K-Means Clustering
  - RFM with Quintile-Based Scoring

**`Description:`** Conducted customer segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model on transactional data from a pizza store. The project applies two different approaches: quintile-based scoring and unsupervised machine learning (K-Means Clustering). The objective is to classify customers into meaningful segments to support personalized marketing strategies and enhance customer retention.

**`Results:`** 
- Identified key customer segments using two methods: Quintile-based scoring and K-Means clustering.
- Proposed personalized marketing strategies such as retention offers and targeted campaigns for each segment to optimize revenue and enhance customer satisfaction.

#### **ðŸ“Œ Data-Driven Digital Marketing Strategy for Sanest: From Market Insights to Multichannel Execution**
**`Link:`** [Data-Driven Digital Marketing Strategy for Sanest: From Market Insights to Multichannel Execution](https://github.com/LamVKiet/Sanest-Digital-Marketing-Strategy)

**`Goal:`** To enhance Sanestâ€™s brand visibility, customer engagement, and online sales through a data-driven, multichannel digital marketing strategy.

**`Description:`** To develop a comprehensive, data-driven digital marketing strategy for Sanest, with a focus on:

- Defining clear business and marketing objectives

- Conducting in-depth market and consumer research

- Analyzing Sanestâ€™s current marketing performance and positioning

- Develop effective branding and multichannel communication strategies.

**`Results:`**
- Developed a data-driven multichannel strategy tailored to Sanest's customer segments.

- Identified key customer insights and market opportunities through consumer behavior analysis.

- Delivered a one-year actionable marketing plan with SMART goals and KPI tracking.

- Proposed optimized content plans and platform-specific strategies to enhance engagement.

- Created templates for landing pages and email campaigns to support brand communication.

#### **ðŸ“ŒSentiment Analysis Application**

**`Link:`** [Sentiment Analysis Application.ipynb](https://github.com/LamVKiet/SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-APPLICATION)

**`Goal:`** Perform sentiment analysis by classifying reviews with a rating above 3 as "Positive" and below 3 as "Negative".

**`Description:`** A web-based sentiment analysis tool using Python and Flask to classify restaurant reviews. It compares Naive Bayes, SVM, and LSTM models to select the best performer for analyzing user-input text and displaying sentiment results with visuals.

**`Results:`** 
- Achieved accurate sentiment classification, with SVM delivering the best performance, followed by LSTM, and Naive Bayes.
